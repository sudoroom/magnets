# Sudo Magnets

These are experiments in 3D-printing fridge magnets for our hackerspace!

They are works in progress. Almost every step of making them is documented in 
the "compile.sh" shell scripts. These scripts have our exact slic3r settings, 
and sed commands which edit the gcode.

The models contain a hole where the magnet goes. You insert it by hand while it's printing. A pause is inserted into the gcode to give you time. It also moves the bed, which hopefully will make a loud distinctive noise to alert you!

We use these magnets: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012ATDD2/ [is there a non-amazon link for this?]
